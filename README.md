Code for my "Half Life Clock" project, done for the hackaday.io 1K
Code competition.


In February of 1991, I arrived for my first day at my employer,
Pixar Animation Studios. Through the years, a number of people at
Pixar have been recognized as having spent half their life at the
Studio. In November of 2017, I will join their illustrious ranks.
I thought it might be fun to make a digital clock which counts down
to that day, using a TM1640 16 digit 7 segment display, an inexpensive
DS3231 clock module and an $3 Arduino module. While this use is
fairly specialized, you can use the ideas and code in this project
to implement a count down clock of your own.

I originally had intended that this serve as a clock, but was unable 
to get all the requisite functionality down into 1K of code.  So now,
it's rather like a calendar: it simply counts down the number of days
until the event programmed into it.
